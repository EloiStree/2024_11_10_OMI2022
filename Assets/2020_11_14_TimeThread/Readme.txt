This package allows to have a time count outside of the game based on DateTime.
Because some code can't be dependent of how when your game is running around.
And that coding that 100x time differently in your games spread every where is not the good solution.
Bad point: 
- You create a dependence to this package.
- If you don't understand the tool you can have thread conflict between Unity and the thread.
